          <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
          <p>My interest in IT comes from my father. When I was young he used to sit me and my brother down with him and play videogames all night. I remember doing my first ever all-nighter with him when I was roughly 5-6 yrs old playing ‘Tail Spin’ on the Sega Mega Drive. My family never had a PC until I was in my late teens so most of my exposure to technology at this point was from video game consoles. For as long as I can remember I have always been intrigued by video games, but never     really thought much of it as a career. I think I didn’t want to turn a passion into a job and then lose the love for gaming.<br><br>
          At high school I took an IT class where it was my first real exposure to coding. The class was based around Visual Basics. I don’t remember much from that class except learning how to create a script that would periodically open and close the CD drive for no reason. At lunchtime we would hang out there and one day another student installed Quake Arena into a shared folder, accessible by all. This allowed us to set up a LAN environment and our lunchtimes were spent rocket jumping and rail-gunning each other. <br><br>
          I’ve decided to study at RMIT via OUA because it allows me to be flexible with my responsibilities. The younger version of me would have been happy to go back to university fulltime but I now have work and life commitments that prevent this. I hopefully intend to combine my current skill set from working in the construction industry and pair it up with an IT field. By doing this, I hope to get the relevant exposure to a range of technical aspects that most people would not be aware of. An example of this is learning to write HTML and CSS. I never had a need to do this before studying with RMIT but after trying my hand at it for Assignment 1, I really enjoyed what I was able to learn and teach myself.
