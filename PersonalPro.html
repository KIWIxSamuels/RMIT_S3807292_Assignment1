           <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
           <p>I recently moved to Brisbane, Australia two years ago. Within this time I have completed more Myers-Briggs, DISC profiles & creativity tests about me than I ever did in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>I have no evidence to suggest that this recruitment tactic is a common occurrence in the Australian workplace and it may have just been a coincidence that these were requested in my industry/job hunt. Nevertheless, the results I have received from these recent tests performed for Assignment 1 have fallen on par with previous results and the amount of information provided, with much acknowledgement to the 16personalities results, can help influence a potential employer fill that     empty spot on their team, or avoid a possible clash of personality types.</p>
          <p>Everyone is unique and these tests highlight the different characteristics each person may have. My results help me identify my strengths and traits. Further to this, it’s made me more aware of my weaknesses and where to focus my energy.</p>
          <p>As a member of a team, my greatness weakness is my stubbornness. This result has been further enforced by my wife after she had read my results. Working in the group assignment will allow me to improve my perception and approval of another team member’s opinion and differences. The upside is I enjoy working in a team. I enjoy achieving; I enjoy reaping the results from a little hard work. I am sociable and confident, and I enjoy uplifting others and finding a better version of my  team mates. At the end of the day, we are there to achieve the same goal and it’s to no benefit to hold anyone down.</p><br><br>
