           <h2>Your Introduction to Kyle Samuels</h2>
           <p>My name is Kyle Samuels and I am 31yrs old. I am a New Zealand Maori and have been in Australia now for just over two years. I speak English and a small amount of Maori. I would like to someday learn another language like C#, C++ or Python. I was recently married last month (May, 2019) and it turns out it isn’t as bad as everyone makes it out to be (yet).</p>
           <p>I grew up in a town 45 minutes north of Auckland, NZ called Hibiscus Coast. I completed my schooling there, finishing high school as a Prefect and for two years I played First-15 rugby as a winger and fullback. Like most people, I wish I could go back and give schooling more of my time than I did. I had a strong interest in Maths and Science but never really followed through because my friends didn’t.</p>
           <p>Outside of high school I tried my hand at a range of different roles; labourer, contact centre staff, travel agent, but I never felt comfortable anywhere unless it involved sitting behind a computer. </p>
           <p>After a few years I decided to join the New Zealand Navy as a helicopter pilot. At the time, to enter the Navy as a pilot you needed to have an Engineering diploma/degree. Fast forward 3 years of study and graduating as a civil engineer, I was ready to enlist, until I found out about Construction Project Management. It is strange to think that you have this plan in place then a fork in the road appears and it opens up a whole new world of options.</p>
           <p></p>

           <p>Fun fact: I represented the North Island of New Zealand in a national American Football game for two years running. I played on the defence team as a Corner Back in both years. One year we needed to rotate out a Wide Receiver from the offence team and they decided to put me on the field. Two plays later and I was in the end zone, on the receiving end of the game winning touchdown. Again, you might think you have this plan in place but a fork in the road appears. When given an opportunity you should always take it – you might be on the receiving end of a winning touchdown.</p>
