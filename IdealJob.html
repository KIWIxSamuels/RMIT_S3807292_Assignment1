           <h2>My Ideal Job - Construction Virtual Design Manager</h2>
           <h3>What makes this job appealling to me?</h3>
           <p>I was unaware a role like this existed until I started to delve into Virtual Reality and its place within the world of construction technology. This would be my ideal role that I would wish to transition too once the construction industry in Australia starts to better incorporate technology into its workplace.
              This position is a combination of construction and technology, a pairing of skill sets that I want to grow. I have a strong interest in technology and anything ‘techie’ and although I work in construction project management, I would feel best suited in a role that involves a mixture of construction and virtual design. This role appeals to me because I would still be heavily involved in the day to day running of a construction site, but be responsible for the implementation and management of the virtual design suite.
          </p>
          <h3>What skills, qualifications and experience would be needed?</h3>
           <p>Industry knowledge and work experience within a construction project management role.<br>
             Exposure to BIM and other common 3D modelling tools.<br>
             An understanding of industry specific software for document management.<br>
             As a manager, a strong ability to work within a team and communicate effectively is a must.<br>
           </p>
           <h3>My skill set? I have a very particular set of skills. Skills i have aquired over a very long career.</h3>
           <p>Good ability to negotiate, especially when it comes to contract terms and finalising costs. <br>
             Excellent verbal skills.<br>
             High level of attention to detail. This is definitely expected when performing QA on site.<br>
             Excellent problem solving skills. I credit this to videogames from an early age.<br>
             Organised and capable of managing multiple tasks at once.<br>
             </p>             
           <h3>What do I think I need to do to get more experience and expand my skillset to suit this role?</h3>
           <p>I believe career-wise, I am on the right trajectory to end up with the skill set to be eligible for a role such as this. If not, I would be capable of pitching this as an idea to my current employer as a potential new role to create for the betterment of the company; to keep the company relevant in today’s technology dependant society. I would anticipate graduating from RMIT with Distinction at a minimum would be a notable addition to my CV if I was ever to proceed down this career pathway.</p><br><br><br>
